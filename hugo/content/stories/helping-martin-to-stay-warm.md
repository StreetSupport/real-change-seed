    **Martin's Story**


    Martin is an older gentleman who frequently accesses the ROC and Rolls community café in the reaching out centre (ROC). Martin was speaking to one of our workers and mentioned that he hadn’t been able to have his heating on in his flat due to waiting on his pension payment. Angie’s Angels accessed real change and placed £30 on his gas card.

  body: Martin returned a few days later over the moon stating that for the first
    time in weeks he had been able to have heating and even a hot bath in his
    flat.
