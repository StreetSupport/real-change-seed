  heading: Anyone can fall on hard times
  body: Very recently a family found themselves struggling to meet the basic needs
    for living. The prospect of not being able to put food on the table along
    with their electric being disconnected was real and distressing. Anyone can
    fall on hard times as life can throw some difficult situations our way. This
    is what one family were dealing with until local charities were contacted
    and responded by providing what this family needed. The family received a
    food parcel and Real Change provided the financial support to keep the
    electric running. These small gifts mean a lot when families are under this
    kind of pressure. Real change exists to provide a response in the moment it
    is most needed. It is because of our Real Change contributors that those who
    are the most vulnerable can receive support.
