    An application for £99 was granted for a male working with the crisis team
    and other agencies around his welfare and safety. He has multiple complex
    needs such has his tenancy being at risk, addiction, mental health and
    issues around anti-social behaviour, lots of the other services involved are
    struggling with the fact that he does not engage with them very often.


    He has recently started coming to the ROC and rolls café where staff there always have a hot meal for him and give him the space he needs to sit and get warm. So, this helps provide his basic needs of food, warmth and friendship, and he has started slowly to engage with us more each time.

    The clothing was a bit of an incentive for him to engage with other services
    in the area by leaving them with the HART team so that he would get the
    medical help and a shower before giving him the clothes, but as we say here
    at Sanctuary trust “Whatever it takes in our power” to help an individual we
    will do.


    Plus, with new fresh clothes after wearing the ones he had for such a long time. Must make a person’s self-worth a little better. After all its not about the monetary value of things it how we make the individual feel about themselves.
