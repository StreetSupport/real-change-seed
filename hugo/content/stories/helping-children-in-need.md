  help: Two single beds
  body: The Sanctuary Trust Crisis team received a call from one of the local
    churches asking if we could help with the funds for 2 single beds for 2
    young children. Their mother had died recently and their farther had slipped
    back into addiction. Things had become unsafe for the children so had been
    placed with their aunt where they would be safe. But she had no beds for
    them to sleep in.

  body: An application to real change was made for Â£250 which then went to the
    panel. The panel granted them the funds and the next day payment was paid to
    the company to supply and deliver the beds. We hope this will make things
    less traumatic for the children, help them have a stable life again and to
    make things a little easier for their aunt.
