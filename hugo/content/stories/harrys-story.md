  name: Harry
  age: N/A
  help: Clothing
  body: Harry fled to Rochdale from outside of the area and ended up sleeping
    rough for several weeks, due to him having a dog and refusing to leave the
    dog.  He had to leave all his clothing and possessions, when he fled, and
    only had two items of clothing and one pair of shoes. After several weeks,
    he was given a dispersal flat and offered help to get his life back on
    track. We provided him with some second-hand clothing and offered him some
    volunteering opportunities in the Sanctuary Trust charity shop, he started
    to help by painting the office and helping to sort through bags of
    donations. Whilst volunteering Harry asked if he could access real change to
    buy some new clothes as he didn’t have anything nice to wear. We applied for
    £90 and took Harry shopping for new trainers, t-shirts, and shorts. He was
    extremely happy and grateful to finally have some nice clothing to wear.
