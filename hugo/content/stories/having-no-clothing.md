  help: Helping with clothing and to possibly obtain teaching
  body: We helped a gentleman in one of our properties, who had no clothing
    barring working clothes and boots. He asked to use the clothing grant which
    we provide, to at least obtain some more changes of clothing so he could
    have a clean set to wear, this help was provided by the people working at
    Sanctuary trust from one of their hostels.

  body: This gentleman is also working at the Sanctuary storehouse doing
    deliveries, volunteering at the menâ€™s group which is held at the reaching
    out centre and at the Sanctuary Sunday breakfast. He is trying to apply for
    a course using funding from real change so that he can try and work at a
    Sanctuary property. He is currently trying to change to a different hostel
    which has less restrictions, so he can try and get into more volunteering
    and work. He is trying to participate in all these programs and work to stay
    out of his addiction and homeless and obtain a better outlook on life.
