  help: Clothing Support
  body: A recently homeless man who was staying in one of our homeless hostels had
    no access to money and had no clothing. He tried to access Angie’s Angels
    basement which offers clothing for free to people, but unfortunately due to
    the gentleman being a slightly larger gentleman, Angie’s Angels was unable
    to provide him with adequate clothing through their free clothing service.

  body: So accessed real change, to acquire the funding for clothing. We received
    some funding with which we took the gentlemen to purchase clothing and he
    now has actual fitting clothing. The gentlemen returned a few days later to
    say thank you and that we had helped him to feel clean and tidy again.
