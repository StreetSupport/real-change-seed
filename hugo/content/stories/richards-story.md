    **This is where things began to change,** Richard struggled throughout his
    time on the streets and found himself asking for help but was informed that
    he did not fit the criteria for support. Richard found this was most
    difficult to accept because he had worked all his life. Although Richard had
    been hurt in the past, he managed to gain the courage to visit a local
    homelessness charity to ask for support. This is where things began to
    change for Richard because the team at the homelessness charity directed him
    to the supported accommodation. When Richard begun staying in supported
    accommodation, he was 69 years old. This is where He started the process of
    rebuilding his life with the support of the staff. Richard was positive the
    whole time he lived at the supported housing project. The staff members said
    when Richard had begun to gain his confidence again, He was helpful and
    liked by the staff and residences. Richard became a good role model to those
    who lived at the supported accommodation. When he celebrated his 70th
    birthday at the supported accommodation, the staff took him out for
    breakfast to help him celebrate. When the time came for Richard leave to
    supported accommodation, he was ready to become more independent. Richard
    was referred to sheltered housing and supported in preparation for the
    interview which was successful as Richard’s application was accepted.
    Richard could not believe how quickly his application had been processed.
    The staff at the supported accommodation applied to real change for new
    clothing for Richard and were able to supply the deposit for his
    accommodation. When Richard moved into his new accommodation, he received
    further support to furnish his new flat. Richard continued to receive
    support to manage his finances until he was able to manage more
    independently.


    **Fully independent**


    Richard is now fully independent and thankful to those who have given to Real change because it is through their generosity that he was able to move into his new accommodation. Richard is now using his experiences to support other people in supported accommodation. Richard is now debt free and today He left a letter for all Staff members saying, “Thank you for all your support, kindness and generosity, you are like angels and will always be in my prayers.” Richard has found a place he can call home and live for the rest of his life. It was through charitable donations that Richard was able to receive financial support to access the essential items of accommodation and clothing. Real change exists to provide this type of financial support to those who are the most vulnerable and at risk of homelessness in our communities. The financial support has been raised by local business and public charitable giving. Your generosity can provide the opportunity for others break free from homelessness.
