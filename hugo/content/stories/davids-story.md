  name: David
  age: N/A
  help: Carpet for his property
  body: David was referred to us by Rochdale Borough Council to help him move to a
    new property. He has everything he needs but his property has no carpets and
    we have had a price given for 3 rooms to be carpeted. David is on basic
    universal credit and has deductions taken from that so is unable to afford
    them himself, we are looking into his benefits at the moment to see if he
    may qualify for any additional components to his claim.

  body: The carpets would go towards helping him settle into his new address and
    feel more settled after moving around for a number of years. this would also
    contribute towards his mental heath being more stable has he as struggled
    with this over the past few months. It has all been arranged for his
    property.
