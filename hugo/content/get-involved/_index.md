    We'd be delighted to come and talk to you about the Campaign at an event you
    are involved in organising, whether that's the weekly meeting at your
    church, a concert/cultural event, a conference your business in putting on
    or your sports team's AGM.

    homeless, please [get in touch](mailto:realchangeoldham@gmail.com) or

    There are lots of roles that need doing to make the campaign a success,
    including:


    * Helping us spread the word by sponsoring public advertising space (JC
    Decaux are matching any ads we can fund-raise for so we reach a bigger
    audience in your local area)


    * Supporting our efforts to get the message out via social media


    * Helping administer grants to people who are homeless


    * Being an 'ambassador' for the campaign within a specific area of the
    borough, or with particular networks such as colleges, churches or community
    groups.
